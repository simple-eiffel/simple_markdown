# ReleaseScribe

**Automated Changelog and Release Notes Generator**

---

## Executive Summary

ReleaseScribe automates the tedious process of writing changelogs and release notes. It parses Git commit history using Conventional Commits format, groups changes by type (features, fixes, breaking changes), and generates professional Markdown release notes.

The tool integrates with Git workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and release management processes. It supports multiple output formats (Markdown, HTML, JSON), customizable templates, and version management. Teams no longer need to manually write "What's New" documentation.

ReleaseScribe follows the "Keep a Changelog" format by default but supports custom templates for different release communication styles (technical, marketing, internal).

## Problem Statement

**The problem:** Software teams struggle to maintain consistent, accurate release documentation:
- **Manual effort** - Developers dread writing changelogs, often skip or rush them
- **Inconsistency** - Different team members format notes differently
- **Missing changes** - Easy to forget features or fixes when writing manually
- **Timing friction** - Release notes written days after changes, details forgotten

**Current solutions:**
- Manual CHANGELOG.md editing (error-prone, inconsistent)
- Generic "What's Changed" auto-generated by GitHub (too raw, no grouping)
- Expensive release management platforms (Jira, LaunchNotes)
- Custom scripts (fragile, unmaintained)

**Our approach:**
- Parse Conventional Commits from Git history
- Group and categorize changes automatically
- Apply professional templates for consistent output
- Integrate into release workflow via CLI or Git hooks
